# Receipt-Date-recongition-OCR
<h3>Fyle Problem Statement</h3>
<h5>Lingraj S V</h5>

To extract the date from the bill receipts of the images and build an cloud API.

The images of Bill reciepts approximately 500 images are considered Using Faster RCNN Model the bounding box prediction of Date 
is done with Resnet50 Architecture as backened.

Later the Images only the detected parts are considered using the Google tesseract the dates are extracted using the regular expression.
